Enforcing \ac{cfi} in C++ programs is complicated by non-constant targets at indirect function calls that is unknown to the construction of \ac{cfg}. This project aims to implement a static analysis tool utilizing new approaches to produce more accurate results on resolving indirect function call targets. The results will be evaluated and compared to other existing approaches, and if successful, this project can help improve both accuracy and performance in enforcing \ac{cfi} in real-world practical C++ programs.

A basic framework foundation of loading LLVM bitcode files and reading the contained LLVM IR has been successfully implemented. Deeper research on class hierarchy tree reconstruction from LLVM IR, as well as overall system design, will be worked on as next steps.
